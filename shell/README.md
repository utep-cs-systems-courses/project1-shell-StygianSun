Project 1 Unix Shell

When "$" is printed, you may enter a command.

Special Characters:
"<" redirects the input to a specified file
">" redirects the output to a specified file
"|" to pipe a command to the specified process

Special Commands:
'cd' followed by a directory path to change working directory
'quit' to exit the shell

The Shell is setup to function alongside the testShell.sh file.
